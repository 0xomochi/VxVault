# VxVault

## Summary

VxVault is a malware management program to automatically download and classify malware samples. VxVault downloads malware samples from links from online sources such as webpages or RSS feeds, downloads them and attempts to identify the malware using VirusTotal. It then sort the malware onto a local file system and into a SQLite database. Furthermore, each sample is archived into a password protected 7zip file for sharing and protection against anti-virus (AV) deletion.
